# MA932_Flocks

![](gifs/cluster_gif.gif)

## To do 

(Not urgent) Collisions, different BCs, 3D

Read papers to do with predator prey collective motion to see whats out there and if we can find a gap that we want to model

Potential Starting Situuations:
Infinite worm: All on [x, L/2] with velocity [1,0], Predator at [L/2, 0], v = [0,1]
Already clustered: ALl pos ~ N([L/2,L/2], var) to create a flock and then observe different predator locations.
